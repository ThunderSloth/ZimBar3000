* spots config                  -- run configuration

Reading The Timers:

* spot time		  -- time last exited

* strikethrough name      -- not spawned last time visited

* exclimation point       -- an especially large spawn

* cyan spot name border   -- spot with shown stats (defaults to last visited)

* spot name background    -- colour based on time last killed

* spot time background	  -- colour based on time last exited

* spot background colours -- based loosly off of a traffic light analogy:

* black spot background   -- has not been visited in the past 2 hours

* gray spot background    -- very recently visited; definitely not respawned

* red spot background     -- stop! likely too soon to revisit; possibly respawned

* green spot background   -- go! optimal time to revisit; likely respawned

* yellow spot background  -- hurry up! past optimal time to revisit

* white spot background   -- far past optimal time; data irrelevant now
